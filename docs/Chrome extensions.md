# Chrome extensions

The [Chrome extensions documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/) is the go to for guides and API references.

In a nutshell, a chrome extension will require two different bundles:

- A popup: this bundle will serve the main interaction between the user and your extension. It's usually found to the right of the url bar on your browser
- A option: this bundle will serve the configurations to your users and can help them store any sort of user specific setting
